\section{Introduction}
The problem I will address in this article is the lack of a specific motivation
theory for project based learning and the increase the few number of academic
works linking self-determination theory(SDT) to educational settings.

For that I will demonstrate the foundations and abstractions used by
SDT and show how the project-based learning(PBL) approach implement
those abstractions and rest on top of those foundations.

I intend to contribute the following in this article:

\begin{itemize}
 
    \item I will describe both SDT and PBL in a concise and straightforward manner,
    drawing parallels between the two models.

    \item I will describe how PBL is a model that fosters the principles of SDT.

\end{itemize}
